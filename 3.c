/*
If a backslash precedes a character that does not appear in the table, the compiler handles the undefined character as the character itself. For example,Â \cÂ is treated as anÂ c.

By default, GCC assumes that the C character escape sequences take on their ASCII values for the target. If this is not correct, you must explicitly define all of the macros below. All of them must evaluate to constants; they are used inÂ caseÂ statements.
theÂ \eÂ andÂ \EÂ escapes are GNU extensions, not part of the C standard.
